        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 2”-thick Porterhouse steak, trimmed (about 2 lb.)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
                <br>Let steak sit at room temperature 30 minutes before cooking, 
                <br> which will help it cook quickly and more evenly.</li>

                <br>

            <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                <br>Heat broiler. Heat a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high heat, then heat oil in pan until smoking. 
                <br> Season steak very generously with salt and pepper and cook until a deep brown crust forms on underside (do not turn), 
                <br> about 4 minutes. Transfer steak to a cutting board, turning it browned side up.</li>
                
                <br>

            <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                <br>Cut meat from bone in 2 pieces (strip steak and filet mignon). 
                <br> Slice both pieces straight down perpendicular to the bone 1” thick. 
                <br> Replace sliced steak around the bone (it should look like a whole sliced steak) and return to skillet, browned side up. 
                <br> Top with butter and broil until butter is melted and steak is medium-rare, 4–6 minutes. 
                <br> Serve steak with buttery pan juices spooned over.</li>    
        </ul>
